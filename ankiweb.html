The Migaku Anki Add-on is a combination of all our previous addons and their features. But it is not only a
combination, we also simplified the set up and usage of the add-on to make it more accessible.

<b>Important:</b> In order to simplify the add-ons usage and setup, some functions were moved to the Migaku Browser
Extension and are now handled from there. If you don't have the Migaku Browser Extension installed, they will not
work. Below, those features are marked as such. If you want to know more about the Migaku Browser Extension you can
